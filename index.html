    <h1>Jennifer Rumsey Parties in Clemson During Pandemic</h1>
    <p>
      This is just a rant about people who claim to want to go into healthcare 
      fields but have been going to giant maskless parties during this pandemic. 
      Jennifer Rumsey, a Microbiology major at <a href="https://www.clemson.edu">Clemson University</a>, has posted videos on her 
      snapchat story multiple times of her out partying, showing giant crowds of
      people indoors and maskless. The video below is from August 2020. I'm just
      really annoyed about people who will probably claim they "care about others"
      on medical school applications doing stuff like this.
